        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text">I am a 23-year-old newbie to code. I was born in Cambodia and moved to Australia when I was 7. 
            I am currently enrolled in the Software Engineering Program at Academy XI. 
            So far I have found the program challenging as coding is different to anything I have done, 
            yet insteresting as I get to learn new skills every single day. 
        </p>

        <h3>What I will learn</h3>
        <p class="text">In Academy XI Software Engineering Program I will learn both Front-end and Back-end programming languages.</p>
