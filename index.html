        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text">I am a 23-year-old newbie to code. I was born in Cambodia and moved to Australia when I was 7. 
            I am currently enrolled in the Sotware Engineering Program at Academy XI. 
            So far I have found the program challenging as coding is diffrent to anything I have done, 
            yet insteresting as I get to learn new skills every single day.
